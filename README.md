# ✅ PROJECT-06

In this project, we address the rising incidence of **liver disease**, driven by factors such as excessive **alcohol** consumption, exposure to **harmful gases**, ingestion of contaminated food, and the use of **drugs** and **anabolic steroids**. our primary objective is to develop a **machine learning** model that predicts whether a patient will develop **liver disease**, thus aiding **doctors**, **hospitals**, and **governments** in planning **health budgets** and implementing effective **prevention policies**. the desired outcome is a **classification** of “yes” or “no.”

to achieve this, we employ **supervised classification** techniques, creating multiple versions of the model using different **algorithms**. we present the **end-to-end** pipeline, encompassing model building, training, **evaluation**, and selection. throughout this project, we discuss which methods to apply, in what sequence, and with which tools. finally, we compare five distinct **algorithms** to determine the optimal approach for this **classification** task.

# ✅ PROCESS

Based on the **business problem** definition and **dataframe** analysis, it is often challenging to identify the ideal **algorithm** for a **machine learning** model. therefore, we adopt an **experimentation** approach, testing multiple **algorithms** with various **hyperparameters** to generate different model versions and compare their **performance**. similarly, the best **preprocessing** techniques are not always clear at the outset, so we also experiment to determine the most effective approach. indeed, the **data scientist** relies on systematic **experimentation** to select the best **algorithm**, technique, and overall strategy.

we begin with **exploratory analysis** immediately after loading the data. this involves **data cleaning** (removing **duplicates**, handling **missing values**) and applying specific transformations if needed. the focus is on understanding the **dataframe**, examining **numerical** and **categorical** variables, exploring their distributions, and identifying **outliers** via **boxplots**, descriptive tables, and **frequency counts**. ensuring there are no duplicate rows or columns is critical to prevent bias in the **model**. the goal is to achieve a **generalizable** solution.

Next is **attribute engineering**, where deeper transformations may be performed, including creating or modifying variables. at this stage, **feature selection** can be employed to choose the most relevant variables for the **machine learning** process. additionally, constructing a **correlation table** helps uncover relationships (positive or negative) between variables and detect possible **multicollinearity**.

After that, we move on to **preprocessing**, converting any remaining text-based variables to numeric formats and finalizing the **machine learning** pipeline, which includes **label encoding**, **normalization**, **standardization**, and **data scaling**. a common practice is to split the **dataframe** into **training** and **testing** sets, ensuring the model learns from the **training** set and is evaluated on fresh **test** data. using the same data for both **training** and **testing** is inadvisable, as the model would already be familiar with it. thus, evaluating the model on new data—with known outcomes—provides an accurate measure of its **performance**.

# ✅ CONCLUSION

There are multiple **machine learning** algorithms applicable to various **problems**. below is an overview of **logistic regression**, **random forest**, **knn**, **decision tree**, and **svm**, outlining their main **advantages** and **disadvantages**.

- **logistic regression**: a simple and fast algorithm especially suited for **binary classification**. it offers a probabilistic interpretation of predictions and evaluates the influence of each **variable**. however, it may struggle with **complex decision boundaries** and **imbalanced classes**.

- **random forest**: an ensemble of **decision trees**, robust against **overfitting** and effective at handling **unbalanced data**. it also identifies the most **important variables**. while powerful, training a large number of trees can be **computationally expensive**, and results can be harder to interpret.

- **knn (k-nearest neighbors)**: a **non-parametric** approach that makes no assumptions about the data distribution. it can handle **complex decision boundaries** effectively. however, it may degrade with **high-dimensional** datasets and can be slow during prediction due to the neighbor search process.

- **decision tree**: an intuitive algorithm that is easy to interpret and visualize, handling both **categorical** and **numeric variables** efficiently. it can be prone to **overfitting** and may require careful tuning to find an optimal **tree** structure.

- **svm (support vector machines)**: well-suited for **complex decision boundaries** and **high-dimensional** data, used in both **classification** and **regression** tasks. it is less susceptible to **overfitting**, but choosing the right **kernel** and **hyperparameters** can be challenging, and interpreting the **model** is often more difficult compared to other algorithms.

The choice of **algorithm** depends on the **context**, **data characteristics**, and **project objectives**. careful experimentation is recommended to assess **performance** before selecting a final approach. After evaluating the five **algorithms**, **random forest** achieved the best **performance** using the **auc score**. despite these results, there are additional **optimization** possibilities, such as incorporating more **relevant variables**, tuning different **hyperparameters**, extending **training time**, and revisiting **data preprocessing**. 

**Machine learning** is an iterative process, allowing repeated cycles of improvement from the initial **analysis** phase. Once the **best model** is chosen, it can be used to generate **predictions** for multiple **patients** simultaneously by loading their data from a **.csv** file. after **standardization**, the **results** can be saved in a new **spreadsheet** and provided to the **business** team for **decision-making** purposes.
